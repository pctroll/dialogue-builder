================

Example of the Dialogue Builder tool used on El Canto del Autana.

You can test it here [http://pctroll.github.io/dialogue-builder/](http://pctroll.github.io/dialogue-builder/).


Usage
-----

* Due to browser issues, it must be run on a web server (remote or local), and not just as a readable html file.
* Set the variables in assets/js/functions.js accordingly to their names (it's pretty straightforward).
* Go to line 11 in assets/js/functions.js and edit the "characterSelection" variable according to the desired selection box for the character.
* The "characterSelection" is set for the value and text in the option HTML tag.
